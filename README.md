# Travel Management System using Java and MySQL
This project was aimed at developing a basic, functional travel management system for travel agencies. The UI was built in NetBeans IDE and MySQL was used as the database choice. A connector program (kind of a plugin) was required to establish a connection between the Java Application and the SQL Database. The connector file can be easily downloaded from the Internet and just be added as a JAR file to the project.

The project sports a simple and minimalistic user interface, with the buttons aligned at a sidebar, improving the aesthetics of the application.<br><br><br>

# Features of the application
The application was designed keeping in mind the needs of a typical travels operator. The functions that are included as follows:
* Create 
* Modify
* Delete
* View
* Export

The above mentioned functions are implemented as queries in MySQL and are fed to the database. Feel free to explore the code.

# Connectivity
As mentioned earlier, a JDBC Connector is required to establish a connection between the Java application and the database. There are various tutorials on YouTube that can help you with the same.
MySQL is my choice of database, as that was taught to me at college with which the project was supposed to be developed.

# Use cases
This project can be used as a reference for beginners who aspire to learn JDBC in a simple way. This project was developed as a part of my college curriculum (in my 3rd semester).
